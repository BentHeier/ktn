Client connects to the server via TCP and the server saves the connection.
The server then listen to messages sent from the client which are encoded with JSON.
The user can now use two commands: login and help. The user can then proceed to log into the system with a username.
When accepted by the server, it sends the history log of messages to the client which is displayed on the screen.
The user can then send messages or use commands (e.g help, names, logout).
The client will constantly be listening to input from the user and then send the request to be handlet by the server.
When the server receives a message, the message is put into the history log and broadcast to every connected user.
The clients recieve the message from the server and displays it on screen.
